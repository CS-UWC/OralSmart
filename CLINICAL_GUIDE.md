# Clinical Risk Assessment Guide

## Overview
Evidence-based oral health risk scoring for pediatric patients using established clinical risk factors.

## Risk Scoring Algorithm

### Major Clinical Findings (+2 points each)
- **Cavitated lesions**: Active caries requiring intervention
- **Missing teeth**: Evidence of severe disease progression  
- **Multiple restorations**: History of high caries activity
- **Enamel changes**: Demineralization (early caries process)
- **Dentin discoloration**: Advanced caries penetration
- **White spot lesions**: Early reversible caries lesions

### Dietary Risk Factors (+1 point each)
- **Sweet/sugary foods**: Primary substrate for cariogenic bacteria
- **Processed foods**: High in added sugars and refined carbohydrates
- **Sugar-sweetened beverages**: High sugar with frequent exposure
- **Processed fruit products**: Added sugars increase cariogenic potential
- **Frequency modifier**: +1 additional point for ≥3 times daily consumption

### Protective Factors (-1 point each)
- **Fluoride water**: Community water fluoridation
- **Fluoride toothpaste**: Daily topical fluoride exposure
- **Professional topical fluoride**: Clinical fluoride applications
- **Regular dental checkups**: Early detection and prevention
- **Pit and fissure sealants**: Physical occlusal surface protection

## Risk Classification

### Thresholds (Standard)
- **High Risk**: ≥8.0 points → Immediate intervention recommended
- **Medium Risk**: 5.2-7.9 points → Regular monitoring, follow-up in 3-6 months
- **Low Risk**: <5.2 points → Continue preventive care, regular check-ups

### Adaptive Thresholds
Thresholds adjust based on data completeness to maintain conservative assessment:

| Data Available | High Threshold | Medium Threshold |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| Complete assessments | 8.0 | 5.2 |
| Single assessment | 6.0 | 3.9 |
| Minimal data | 4.0 | 2.6 |

## Clinical Evidence Base
- Stephan curve research (frequency vs. quantity impact)
- Community water fluoridation effectiveness studies
- Caries process progression (demineralization to cavitation)
- Evidence-based preventive intervention outcomes
